## Pull Request Checklist

Before sending your pull requests, make sure you do the following:

## How to become a contributor and submit your own code

### Contributing code

If you have improvements to git-auto-commit, send us your pull requests! For those
just getting started, Github has a
[how to](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

Git-auto-commit team members will be assigned to review your pull requests. Once the
pull requests are approved and pass continuous integration checks, we will apply `ready to pull` label to your change. This means we are
working on getting your pull request submitted to our internal repository. After
the change has been submitted internally, your pull request will be merged
automatically on GitHub.

If you want to contribute, start working through the git-auto-commit codebase,
navigate to the
[Github "issues" tab](https://github.com/Heeming/git-auto-commit/issues) and start
looking through interesting issues.
If you decide to start on an issue, leave a comment so that other people know that
you're working on it. If you want to help out, but not alone, use the issue
comment thread to coordinate.
