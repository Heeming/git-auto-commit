## How to become a contributor and submit your own code

### Contributing code

If you have improvements to TensorFlow, send us your pull requests! For those
just getting started, Github has a
[how to](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

Git-auto-commit team members will be assigned to review your pull requests. Once the
pull requests are approved and pass continuous integration checks, we will apply `ready to pull` label to your change. This means we are
working on getting your pull request submitted to our internal repository. After
the change has been submitted internally, your pull request will be merged
automatically on GitHub.
